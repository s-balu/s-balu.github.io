### Data products

The [DORCHA](https://solas-sims.github.io/projects/dorcha/) data products, including snapshots, halo catalogs, and merger trees, will be made available [here](https://solas-sims.github.io/data_products/) in the near future. In the meantime please send me an email.

For the dark matter merger trees of the $$\rm{L}10\_\rm{N}2048$$ Genesis box used in [Ventura+24](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.529..628V/abstract) and [Ventura+25](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025MNRAS.540..483V/abstract) go [here](https://zenodo.org/records/10608236). This run consists of $$2048^3$$ dark matter particles in a cosmological volume of side $$10~h^{-1}\,\rm{Mpc}$$. There are 120 snapshots between $$z=30$$ and $$5$$.  Get in touch if you want the full snapshot data.

### Code

Almost all of my codes are available at my [github profile](https://github.com/s-balu). Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
