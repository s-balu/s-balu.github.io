Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Galaxy Evolution group of [Prof. Jose O&ntilde;orbe](http://www.joseonorbe.com) at the University of Seville, Spain.

My research focuses on galaxy formation and evolution, particularly during Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR). To explore these early phases of the Universe, I use large-scale semi-analytical models alongside dark matter-only N-body and hydrodynamical simulations. For more information, please see my [publications here](https://s-balu.github.io/publications/).

I earned my PhD in Astrophysics from the University of Melbourne, working with Prof. Stuart Wyithe and Dr. Bradley Greig. A copy of my thesis is available [here](https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/items/1976b56b-ae45-418c-9823-af543d408e49).

I am originally from a small town in the southern Indian state of [Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala), where [Malayalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam) is the native language. I completed my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Physics at Pondicherry University, located in the union territory of Puducherry, where [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language) is widely spoken.

Note about my name:\\
TL;DR – _Mr. Sreedhar_ is my father, and I am __Mr. Balu__! My published works appear under the name __Sreedhar Balu__.
This is because, where I come from, we follow a [patronymic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic#South_Asia) naming system: Sreedhar is my father’s given name, not a family name.
