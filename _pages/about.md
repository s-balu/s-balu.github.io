I work mostly on galaxy formation and evolution, with a particular focus on Cosmic Dawn and the [Epoch of Reionisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reionization) (EoR). For this I make use of large-scale semi-analytical models as well as darkmatter-only _N_-body and  hydrodynamical simulations. For more information, see my [publications page](https://s-balu.github.io/publications/).

I am currenlty a postdoctoral researcher in the galaxy evolution group of [Prof. Jose O&ntilde;rbe](http://www.joseonorbe.com) at the University of Seville, Spain. I earned my PhD in Astrophysics from the University of Melbourne under [Prof. Stuart Wyithe](https://rsaa.anu.edu.au/people/professor-stuart-wyithe) and Dr. Bradley Greig. A copy of my thesis is available [here](https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/items/1976b56b-ae45-418c-9823-af543d408e49).

I am from a small town in the south Indian state of [Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala) (where we speak [Malayalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam)). I completed my degree in Physics at the Pondicherry University in the union territory of [Puducherry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pondicherry) (where [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language) is the main language).

Note about my name:\\
**TLDR**: Mr Sreedhar is my father and I am Mr Balu! My published works are listed under **Sreedhar Balu**

We employ a [patronymic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic#South_Asia) naming system where I am from which means that Sreedhar is my father's given name and not my family name.
