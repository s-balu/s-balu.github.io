I spent a considerable amount of aimlessly scolling through academic websites and other interesting tidbits. This page will be a placeholder for my _curated_ links.

Everything in this page is obviously coloured by my personal tastes. And if you think I have read and know everything here, you have a much higher opinion of me than I do myself!

### Useful links

* [NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/) and the [LEVEL5](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/)
* [astro-ph/new](https://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph/new), [astrobites](https://astrobites.org/), [AAS Nova](https://aasnova.org/)

### Coding (mostly Python)

There are plenty of resoures out there for learning coding especially python. The best ones I have come across, particularly from an astro perspective, are the following:

* [Imad Pasha](https://github.com/prappleizer)'s [Python for Astronomers](https://prappleizer.github.io/)
* [Jake VanderPlas](http://vanderplas.com/)'s [blog](http://jakevdp.github.io/) and [books](https://jakevdp.github.io/pages/about.html)
