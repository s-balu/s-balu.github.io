During my PhD, I developed a computational astrophysics lab module. This is used in the Computational Physics lab for third-year undergraduate students at the University of Melbourne, Australia.

Over two weeks (six sessions of three hours each), students are introduced to the fundamentals of _N_-body simulations using a model of a Milky Way–sized galaxy. The code includes an option to toggle the gravitational influence of the galaxy’s dark matter halo, allowing students to explore its role in the dynamical stability of galactic systems.

The associated code and teaching notes are available [here](https://github.com/s-balu/UniMelb_3rdYr_MilkyWay_Nbody). Please get in touch if you want to know more about this!
