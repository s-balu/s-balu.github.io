              of cosmic hydrogen using semi-analytic models (such as M\,eraxes)
              requires N-body simulations within large volumes and high-mass
              resolutions. For this, we use a simulation of side-length 210\,h-1

              this simulation using the darkforest Monte Carlo merger tree

              Using this augmented simulation, we explore the impact of mass
              resolution on the predicted reionization history as well as the
              impact of X-ray heating on the 21-cm global signal and the 21-cm
              power spectra. We also explore the cosmic variance of 21-cm
              statistics within 703\,h-3\,Mpc3 sub-volumes. We find that the
              midpoint of reionization varies by {$\Delta$}z {$\sim$} 0.8 and
              that the cosmic variance on the power spectrum is underestimated by
              a factor of 2--4 at k {$\sim$} 0.1--0.4\,Mpc-1 due to the
              non-Gaussian nature of the 21-cm signal. To our knowledge, this
              work represents the first model of both reionization and galaxy
              formation which resolves low-mass atomically cooled galaxies while
              simultaneously sampling sufficiently large scales necessary for
              exploring the effects of X-rays in the early Universe.},

              remnants of its earliest stars? We address this question using the
              Dorcha (Gaelic for Dark ; DUR-uh-khuh) suite: a set of 25
              high-resolution, dark-matter-only cosmological zoom-in simulations
              of Milky Way analogue (MWA) haloes evolved to z = 0. Of these, 15
              are isolated and the rest are in pairs, similar to the MW and M31.
              By identifying and tagging the most bound material in high-redshift
              (z {$\geq$} 5) progenitor haloes -- those likely to host early star
              formation -- we track the present-day phase-space distribution of
              this ancient component. We find that this material is highly
              centrally concentrated at z = 0, with 90 -- 100 per cent residing
              within r {$\lessequivlnt$} 15 h-1 kpc. It exhibits steep density
              profiles ({$\rho$} {$\propto$} r-4), low velocity dispersions ({$
              \sigma$}r/{$\sigma$}max {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.6), and radially biased
              orbits ({$\beta$} {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.5 for r {$\greaterequivlnt
              $} 0.1 R200), consistent with a relaxed, centrally embedded
              population. These results hold across haloes with diverse formation
              histories and environments, suggesting that the dynamical signature
              of early progenitors is robust to later mergers and interactions.
              Our findings imply that the fossil record of the first generations
              of stars -- including Population III and extremely metal-poor stars
              -- should be sought in the innermost regions of the Milky Way,
              where they retain distinctive kinematic imprints. While these
              stellar populations may overlap, we caution that low metallicity
              does not uniquely identify ancient stars, nor vice versa. The
              Dorcha suite thus provides a physically motivated baseline for
              interpreting observations from Galactic Archaeology surveys

              This can be achieved by enabling traditional simulation methods to
              run at lower resolution and then efficiently computing
              high-resolution data corresponding to the simulated low-resolution
              data. In this work, we investigate the application of a Wasserstein
              Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) model, previously proposed in
              the literature, to increase the particle resolution of
              dark-matter-only simulations. We reproduce prior results, showing
              the WGAN model successfully generates high-resolution data with
              summary statistics, including the power spectrum and halo mass
              function, that closely match those of true high-resolution
              simulations. However, we also identify a limitation of the WGAN
              model in the form of smeared features in generated high-resolution
              data, particularly in the shapes of dark-matter halos and
              filaments. This limitation points to a potential weakness of the
              proposed WGAN-based super-resolution method in capturing the
              detailed structure of halos, and underscores the need for further
              development in applying such models to cosmological data.},

              includes the chemical evolution of the IGM, with metals released
              through supernova-driven bubbles that expand according to the
              Sedov--Taylor model. We found that SN-driven metal bubbles are
              generally small, with radii typically of 150\,ckpc at z~= 6. Hence,
              the majority of the first galaxies are likely enriched by their own
              star formation. However, as reionization progresses, the feedback
              effects from the UV background become more pronounced, leading to a

              the signal through the power spectrum (PS). The signal, however, is
              expected to be highly non-Gaussian due to the complex topology of
              reionization and X-ray heating. We investigate the
              non-Gaussianities of X-ray heating and reionization, by calculating
              the skew spectrum (SS) of the 21-cm signal using meraxes, which
              couples a semi-analytic galaxy population with seminumerical
              reionization simulations. The SS is the cross-spectrum of the
              quadratic temperature brightness field with itself. We generate a
              set of seven simulations from z = 30 to 5, varying the halo mass
              threshold for hosting star formation, the X-ray luminosity per star
              formation rate, and the minimum X-ray energy escaping host
              galaxies. We find the SS is predominantly negative as a function of
              redshift, transitioning to positive towards the start of
              reionization, and peaking during the mid-point of reionization. We
              do not see a negative dip in the SS during reionization, likely due

              106-1011M{$\odot$}, comparing continuous and bursty star formation
              scenarios, which reflect underlying assumptions of instantaneous
              and delayed feedback, and we allow for metallicity-dependent
              feedback efficiency. Delayed feedback induces oscillations in Zg
              and Z{$\star$}, with Zg declining sharply at low stellar and halo
              masses. This decline shifts to higher stellar and halo masses as
              the redshift decreases. Reionization introduces significant scatter
              , producing an upturn followed by rapid Zg decline.
              Metallicity-dependent feedback moderates this decline at z = 7-10,

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Using a semi-analytic galaxy formation model, we study
              analogues of eight z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 12 galaxies recently
              discovered by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We select
              analogues from a cosmological simulation with a (311\,cMpc)3 volume
              and an effective particle number of 1012 enabling the resolution of
              every atomic-cooling galaxy at z {$\leq$} 20. We vary model
              parameters to reproduce the observed ultraviolet (UV) luminosity
              function at 5 \&lt; z \&lt; 13, aiming for a statistically
              representative high-redshift galaxy mock catalogue. Using the
              forward-modelled JWST photometry, we identify analogues from this
              catalogue and study their properties as well as possible
              evolutionary paths and local environment. We find faint JWST
              galaxies (MUV {$\greaterequivlnt$} - 19.5) to remain consistent
              with the standard galaxy formation model and that our fiducial
              catalogue includes large samples of their analogues. The properties
              of these analogues broadly agree with conventional spectral energy
              distribution-fitting results, except for having systematically
              lower redshifts due to the evolving ultraviolet luminosity function
              , and for having higher specific star formation rates as a result
              of burstier histories in our model. On the other hand, only a
              handful of bright galaxy analogues can be identified for the
              observed z {$\sim$} 12 galaxies. Moreover, in order to reproduce
              the z {$\greaterequivlnt$} 16 JWST galaxy candidates, boosting
              star-forming efficiencies through reduced feedback regulation and
              increased gas depletion rate is necessary relative to models of
              lower redshift populations. This suggests star formation in the
              first galaxies could differ significantly from their lower redshift
              counterparts. We also find that these candidates are subject to
              low-redshift contamination, which is present in our fiducial
              results as both the dusty or quiescent galaxies at z {$\sim$} 5.},

  abstract = {Simulating Population (Pop.) III star formation in mini-haloes in
              a large cosmological simulation is an extremely challenging task
              but it is crucial to estimate its impact on the 21 cm power
              spectrum. In this work, we develop a framework within the
              semi-analytical code MERAXES to estimate the radiative backgrounds
              from Pop. III stars needed for the computation of the 21 cm signal.
              We computed the 21 cm global signal and power spectrum for
              different Pop. III models varying star formation efficiency,
              initial mass function and specific X-ray luminosity per unit of
              star formation (LX/SFR). In all the models considered, we find Pop.
              III stars have little to no impact on the reionization history but
              significantly affect the thermal state of the intergalactic medium
              (IGM) due to the strong injection of X-ray photons from their
              remnants that heat the neutral IGM at z {$\geq$} 15. This is
              reflected not only on the 21 cm sky-averaged global signal during
              the Cosmic Dawn but also on the 21 cm power spectrum at z {$\leq$}
              10 where models with strong Pop. III X-ray emission have larger
              power than models with no or mild Pop. III X-ray emission. We
              estimate observational uncertainties on the power spectrum using
              21CMSENSE and find that models where Pop. III stars have a stronger
              X-ray emission than Pop. II are distinguishable from models with no
              or mild Pop. III X-ray emission with 1000 h observations of the
              upcoming SKA1-low.},
